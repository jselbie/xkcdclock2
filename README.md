# xkcdclock2
=========

This is an updated version of the original [xkcd clock](https://github.com/jselbie/xkcdclock) written in Java with an older Android SDK.  This verison is a port of the original code to Kotlin and some cleanup and bug fixes.

Demonstrates how to rotate an onscreen bitmap with touch. It was inspired the strip ["Now"](https://xkcd.com/1335/) from the [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) web comic.

This is an an Android app that demonstrates the following:

1. Custom Canvas drawing on a View
2. Handling Touch events, converting relative movement to angular directions, and applying that to the view's rotation
